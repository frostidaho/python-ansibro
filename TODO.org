* TODO Simplify / fix NeedsPass 
Try to make it somewhat testable
- [[file:src/isna/util.py::class%20NeedsPass:][NeedsPass]]

* TODO Change AnsibleArgs.from_ssh
It might be better to just not specify 'ansible_user'
if no user is explicitly given, as then it should fall back
to whoever is setup in ~/.ssh/config, or if none is given 
the user itself.
- [[file:src/isna/playbook.py::if%20user%20is%20None:][from_ssh]]

* TODO Add support for relative file paths inside playbook templates
Since the playbook is written to a temporary file any relative 
imports won't work.
- Look into 'ansible_search_path'
- ansible_search_path :: a list of paths to search in finding vars, and maybe also other templates?
  - In any event, it doesn't appear to be fully implemented yet as of Ansible v2.2
