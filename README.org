* Isna a wrapper for ansible

~Isna~ is a wrapper for ansible, which simplifies its use when working with one or a few machines. When it was created there was no support
in Ansible for python3 and some machines where running Ansible v1.x while others were on v2.x. As a consequence it was written by wrapping
the ansible executable instead of using Ansible's python libraries.

It still works (as of Ansible 2.5.0), but it is not being actively developed. If I work more on this project, it'll probably be rewritten
to use the ansible python libraries.
